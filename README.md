# Data Accessibility Webpage

Take a look at the 'Webpage Demo.MOV' link above to see the final product.

**Overview:**

Was tasked with creating a supplementary webpage within an existing website that would be used to classify satellite data.  Used my computational thinking skills to learn the three fundamental web development languages and build a functional website.  Ended up utilizing a dynamic parser that would check the text file for satellite attributes that were then manipulated on the website and translated into a new file.

**What I Learned:**

•	The three core languages of web development.
<br>
•	The ability to use computational thinking to transition to a new coding language.
<br>
•	How to pinpoint and fix bugs within a computer program.
<br>
•	Seeing a project morph from virtually nothing into a functional webpage.
