## Data Accessibility Webpage

Take a look at the "Webpage Demo.mov" link above to see the final product.

**Overview:**

Created a webpage from the ground up that allowed employees to easily access and manipulate satellite data.  Gained working knowledge of front-end website languages and developed an aesthetically pleasing and functional platform that the company employs to save time and become more efficient in their projects.  Ended up utilizing a dynamic parser that would check the text file for satellite attributes that were then manipulated on the website and translated into a new file.

**What I Learned:**

•	The three core languages of web development.
<br>
•	The ability to use computational thinking to transition to a new coding language.
<br>
•	How to pinpoint and fix bugs within a computer program.
<br>
•	Seeing a project morph from virtually nothing into a functional webpage.
